# All Names Matter: Mitigating Racial Bias in Word Embeddings with Last Name-Based Counterfactual Data Substitution

This repository contains (or gives links to) the code, data sets, embeddings, models and analysis generated and used for the project <em>All Names Matter: Mitigating Racial Bias in Word Embeddings with Last Name-Based Counterfactual Data Substitution</em>.

This project is part of the requiremnts for W266: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, of the Master in Information and Data Science program at UC Berkely. 

## Final Report
You can find the final paper for this project in this repo, or clicking [here](./W266_FinalProjectReport.pdf)

## Datasets
We used Wikipedia data to create the baseline corpus in our experiment. We got a dump file with over 50,000,000 articles. It is publicaly available [here.](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/) We used the dump called [enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2.](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/)

We also used the US Census to get last names and race data. We downloaded the [Decennial Census Surname Files (2010, 2000)](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/surnames.html) that can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/surnames.html)
